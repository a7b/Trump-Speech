Trump Speech
------------
Trump speech is a program that analyzes a transcript of speeches made by Trump using markov chains, and creates things that Trump very well might say...
Written in java, and based on https://github.com/techlabeducation/ai/blob/master/markov/MarkovChain.java
Feel free to add on.  It could use more training data (trump sayings only please) and something to more accurately decide grammar.
